# To - Do List 
A C++ Graphical User Interface application created by using the cross platform WxWidgets GUI Library. 

This project runs on all OS and uses native controls when displaying the window, which means that the game looks slightly different depending on which OS you are playing it on. Regardless, there should be no issue whatsoever.

The ToDo List is very simple. The user can add tasks to the checklist by entering the task in the input field and adding the task in the Checklist box by either pressing Enter key or clicking on the Add button. The user can select tasks, navigate tasks by using arrow keys and can check/uncheck the tasks by clicking on the box present at the left of each task. The user can delete the selected task by pressing Del key and the can clear the entire checklist box by clicking on the Clear button.

The ToDo List saves all the tasks in a text file after closing the app. When the app is opened again, all the tasks are loaded from the text file along with the checked/unchecked status of each task.


## Pre Requisites
1. A C++ language compiler.
2. Visual Studio or any other IDE which can open .sln files.
3. WxWidgets Library installed and already compiled on your system.
